## Dataset Creation/Usage


### Text Corpus

1. Download the data 

2. Specify the vocabulary as a dictonary element in ```doctr/datasets/vocabs.py```

3. Run the preprocess code in preprocess.py to generate dataset of valid words from the text file.

```sh
python misc_code/preprocess.py --input_path /path/to/data.text --output_path data/trial --vocab devanagiri --sample 0.5 --unique --continue_check
```

4. Download the fonts from [here](https://github.com/iitb-research-code/indic-fonts/tree/main/devanagiri_google) whose directory path must be passed during training

5. Can Generate Image Dataset From the text and fonts using misc_code/generate_image_dataset.py
```sh
python misc_code/generate_image_dataset.py --word_file test.txt --font_dir fonts --out_dir sample_data
```

## Changes Made

1) Included text_preprocess.py [Preprocess data], generate_image_dataset.py, generate_random.py

2) In references/train_pytorch made finding text length general to all os (previously only for linux)

3) In doctr/utils/fonts.py added support for RAQM layout engine (needed for tamil)

4) In doctr/datasets/generator/base.py modified synthesize_text_img function to use RAQM layout engine and made the images centered with padding provided as pixels. Added support for random word synthesis and sequential synthesis.

    The old one provided inconistent placing of text - It was not intensional - It was random inconsistency due to font property - Some fonts where always overflowing the image boundaries more than 80%, some fonts where always perfectly fit
    
    Rather than having the random offest due to font's property it would be better to have a centered image for every font and then randomly offset it (yet to be implemented) so that he offset doesnt overfit to font style.

5) Recent pull changed the AbstractDataset Class definition. So modified the code in required places.

## Training Details

```
python references/recognition/train_pytorch.py crnn_vgg16_bn --train_txt_path TRAIN_TXT_PATH --val_txt_path VAL_TXT_PATH --vocab VOCAB_NAME --name NAME_OF_EXP --epochs 10 --font FONTS_PATH --random_flag
```
Set random_flag to use default random word and font selection, otherwise use sequential selection

The resulting models is saved in *models* dir in the repository (ensure the directory is is actually present)

## Vocab - Extra

In the vocab_builder directory there is source vocab for bengali, gujarati, gurumukhi, devnagiri(hindi+english), kannada, malayalam, oriya and telugu.
